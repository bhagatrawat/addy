            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I am Aditya Rawat. I am 11 years old. This is an entire page that has the reserved right for you to know about me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some basic background knowledge is that I was born on August 30th, 2005 in India. I have a brother named Shreyas who is 6 years of age. You may know that I am a coder. I have learned HTML5 and CSS3. But while I’m not doing that stuff, I am being a kid. In my free time, my inner gamer is released. I play a lot of Minecraft and sometimes Roblox too(don’t judge). I play Forza Horizon Motorsport 3 on Xbox and Star Wars Battlefront. When I’m not gaming, I’m outside playing sports. I swim, play tennis, and play soccer. When I’m not doing either, I am researching technology and studying upcoming tech. I find it pleasing knowing about the century we’re all in. Other than that, I just play with my friends. But then they all moved. Luckily, I am moving to Eastwood Village where all my friends are close by.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy reading too. I read various books but my personal favorite series are the Harry Potter and Percy Jackson series. I have read all the Rick Riordan and J.K. Rowling books.
            </p>
            <p>
                While we’re on the studying subject, I’ll tell you about my school. This year I am going to Sierra Vista Middle School. Sierra Vista is a pretty small school compared to other middle schools, but it has many amazing features. There is a game room, an entire theater room, and a big music room. Personally I like it a lot. They even give free spirit wear sometimes. Enough about my school anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s pretty much everything you need to know about me. I’m Aditya Rawat, Signing Off.
