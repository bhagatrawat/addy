                Hi! I am Aditya. I am an 11-year old that enjoys creating websites like the one that you are on. I am converting to Middle School this year. My birthday is on August 30<sup>th</sup> and I will turn 12 years old this year. I love making jokes and everyone says I talk too much. I read various books, but I enjoy the Pery Jackson and Harry Potter series. You can follow or join me on Google+, Twitter, and LinkedIn. You can also email me at a******t@gmail.com.(You should know this info, since it is on the Contact Me Page.) I doodle when I'm bored or I just play some games. I am moving to Eastwood Village over the summer and can't wait. Most of my friends have moved to that area, so I can join them again.
